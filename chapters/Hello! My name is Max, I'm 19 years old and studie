Hello! My name is Max, I'm 19 years old and studied in NTUST, majored in Electrical engineering. I am interested in drawing, learning the knowledge of computer science, you can see my blog which is also created by Rails. My art and creation by sketching, painting or Illustrator are also included in my blog!

There are several reasons for me to join the staff team of Global Hacker Game 2016, first of all, I have already participated in Global Hacker Game 2015 and I have a great experience on building products with Rails, moreover, this event makes me become more confident on making stuff and finally I can build a blog by myself, this is all by self-learning on web development in just a half of the year and influenced my life a lot.

Another reason is I am planning on participating in Make School 2 years program, and joining this event gives me a great oppurtunity to meet the Make School team directly, discussing about the program and I really wish I can hear Jeremy Rossmann's speech again, the speech he took last year inspires me a lot, I become more positive, more interest on learning and even more passionate on web development.

Last but not least, I wish during the event, I can make more friends, sharing my self-learning experiences, learning the thing what I havn't known before and teaching others with passion! Thank you!
